                        generation. That was me
                        growing up. At least ever since my 6th grade English
                        teacher told me she'd be signing my book some day. I'd re-written part of <a class="textLink"
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crystal_Cave" target="_blank">The Crystal Cave</a>
                        for a book report. It was during my
                        first weird period of binge reading.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">I'd go on to get my undergrad in 2009 - an english degree from UMaine Orono.
                        Figured brushing shoulders with
                        Stephen
                        King's teachers might rub off some of the magic - that my love for books made it worth shelling
                        out the loans
                        I'm still paying</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">It didn't pay anything - I wrote sporatically less and less. Any goal or
                        direction began to fade. Meanwhile,
                        the degree didn't help me
                        get a job - or really help me
                        do
                        anything at all. Still... deep down I knew it was really my own fault. It was my own laziness
                        and lack of
                        creativity - my
                        limited intellect. My
                        failure. My limitation. Eventually I became bitter. I stopped reading. I still binge a book here
                        and there, but
                        I have too many things to do and learn. My father always said that reading was for lazy people,
                        but sometimes I
                        think
                        he said that because my mother read so much.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">For 2 years I struggled, convinced it'd come find me. That some manic-fueled
                        surge would push out everything
                        I've ever want to say. Instead, I stumbled from a political internhip, to the census, to camp
                        counselor, to
                        cashier.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The fridid, bleak winter of 2011 was when I found myself unemployed. My
                        now-wife ready to leave me, no money,
                        no
                        self-esteem. I drank a lot that winter - also wrote the most I ever had. But that ego of mine
                        always kept me
                        from submitting to publishers. And still - I needed money.
                        Desperate, I called up a temp staffing agency, and that's when I began my career
                        at Liberty. Since April 2011, I've worked my way in and up at Liberty. Right now I'm working in
                        Legal IT. I may
                        have given up on writing,
                        but I've found my career and I'm making money. I may have given up my soul, but I have a family
                        now. My boss is
                        giving me this bootcamp - this chance - to do something better every day. I like what coding
                        I've learned at
                        work, and I want to get paid to do it. Writing was too damn boring anyway.</p>
